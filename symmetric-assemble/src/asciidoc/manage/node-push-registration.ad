You can open registration from the command line with the following command:

`bin/symadmin open-registration --engine <engine name> <node group> <external id> <sync url>`

The <node group>, <external id>, and <sync url> should match the `group.id`, `external.id`, and `sync.url` in the registering node's <<Node Properties File>>.
